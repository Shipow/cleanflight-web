<h1>Battery Monitoring</h1>

<p>Cleanflight has a battery monitoring feature.  The voltage of the main battery can be measured by the system and used to trigger a low-battery warning <a href="Buzzer.md">buzzer</a>, on-board status LED flashing and LED strip patterns.</p>

<p>Low battery warnings can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help ensure you have time to safely land the aircraft</li>
<li>Help maintain the life and safety of your LiPo/LiFe batteries, which should not be discharged below manufacturer recommendations</li>
</ul>

<p>Minimum and maximum cell voltages can be set, and these voltages are used to auto-detect the number of cells in the battery when it is first connected.</p>

<p>Per-cell monitoring is not supported, as we only use one ADC to read the battery voltage.</p>

<h2>Supported targets</h2>

<p>All targets support battery voltage monitoring unless status.</p>

<h2>Connections</h2>

<p>When dealing with batteries <strong>ALWAYS CHECK POLARITY!</strong></p>

<p>Measure expected voltages <strong>first</strong> and then connect to the flight controller.  Powering the flight controller with
incorrect voltage or reversed polarity will likely fry your flight controller. Ensure your flight controller
has a voltage divider capable of measuring your particular battery voltage.</p>

<h3>Naze32</h3>

<p>The Naze32 has an on-board battery divider circuit; just connect your main battery to the VBAT connector.</p>

<p><strong>CAUTION:</strong>  When installing the connection from main battery to the VBAT connector, be sure to first disconnect the main battery from the frame/power distribution board.  Check the wiring very carefully before connecting battery again.  Incorrect connections can immediately and completely destroy the flight controller and connected peripherals (ESC, GPS, Receiver etc.).</p>

<h3>CC3D</h3>

<p>The CC3D has no battery divider.  To use voltage monitoring, you must create a divider that gives a 3.3v 
MAXIMUM output when the main battery is fully charged.  Connect the divider output to S5_IN/PA0/RC5.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>S5_IN/PA0/RC5 is Pin 7 on the 8 pin connector, second to last pin, on the opposite end from the 
GND/+5/PPM signal input.</p></li>
<li><p>When battery monitoring is enabled on the CC3D, RC5 can no-longer be used for PWM input.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Sparky</h3>

<p>See the <a href="Board%20-%20Sparky.md">Sparky board chapter</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Enable the <code>VBAT</code> feature.</p>

<p>Configure min/max cell voltages using the following CLI setting:</p>

<p><code>vbat_scale</code> - Adjust this to match actual measured battery voltage to reported value.</p>

<p><code>vbat_max_cell_voltage</code> - Maximum voltage per cell, used for auto-detecting battery voltage in 0.1V units, i.e. 43 = 4.3V</p>

<p><code>set vbat_warning_cell_voltage</code> - Warning voltage per cell; this triggers battery-out alarms, in 0.1V units, i.e. 34 = 3.4V</p>

<p><code>vbat_min_cell_voltage</code> - Minimum voltage per cell; this triggers battery-out alarms, in 0.1V units, i.e. 33 = 3.3V</p>

<p>e.g.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">set vbat_scale = 110
set vbat_max_cell_voltage = 43
set vbat_warning_cell_voltage = 34
set vbat_min_cell_voltage = 33
</code></pre></div>
<h1>Current Monitoring</h1>

<p>Current monitoring (amperage) is supported by connecting a current meter to the appropriate current meter ADC input (see the documentation for your particular board).</p>

<p>When enabled, the following values calculated and used by the telemetry and OLED display subsystems:
* Amps
* mAh used
* Capacity remaining</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Enable current monitoring using the CLI command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">feature CURRENT_METER
</code></pre></div>
<p>Configure the current meter type using the <code>current_meter_type</code> settings here:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Sensor Type</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>ADC/hardware sensor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Virtual sensor</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Configure capacity using the <code>battery_capacity</code> setting, in mAh units.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using an OSD that expects the multiwii current meter output value, then set <code>multiwii_current_meter_output</code> to <code>1</code> (this multiplies amperage sent to MSP by 10).</p>

<h3>ADC Sensor</h3>

<p>The current meter may need to be configured so the value read at the ADC input matches actual current draw.  Just like you need a voltmeter to correctly calibrate your voltage reading you also need an ammeter to calibrate the current sensor.</p>

<p>Use the following settings to adjust calibration:</p>

<p><code>current_meter_scale</code>
<code>current_meter_offset</code></p>

<h3>Virtual Sensor</h3>

<p>The virtual sensor uses the throttle position to calculate an estimated current value. This is useful when a real sensor is not available. The following settings adjust the virtual sensor calibration:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Setting</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>current_meter_scale</code></td>
<td>The throttle scaling factor [centiamps, i.e. 1/100th A]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>current_meter_offset</code></td>
<td>The current at zero throttle (while disarmed) [centiamps, i.e. 1/100th A]</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>There are two simple methods to tune these parameters:  one uses a battery charger and another depends on actual current measurements.</p>

<h4>Tuning Using Actual Current Measurements</h4>

<p>If you know your craft&rsquo;s current draw while disarmed (Imin) and at maximum throttle while armed (Imax), calculate the scaling factors as follows:
<code>
current_meter_scale = (Imax - Imin) * 100000 / (Tmax + (Tmax * Tmax / 50))
current_meter_offset = Imin * 100
</code>
Note: Tmax is maximum throttle offset (i.e. for <code>max_throttle</code> = 1850, Tmax = 1850 - 1000 = 850)</p>

<p>For example, assuming a maximum current of 34.2A, a minimum current of 2.8A, and a Tmax <code>max_throttle</code> = 1850:
<code>
current_meter_scale = (Imax - Imin) * 100000 / (Tmax + (Tmax * Tmax / 50))
                    = (34.2 - 2.8) * 100000 / (850 + (850 * 850 / 50))
                    = 205
current_meter_offset = Imin * 100 = 280
</code></p>

<h4>Tuning Using Battery Charger Measurement</h4>

<p>If you cannot measure current draw directly, you can approximate it indirectly using your battery charger.<br>
However, note it may be difficult to adjust <code>current_meter_offset</code> using this method unless you can 
measure the actual current draw with the craft disarmed.</p>

<p>Note:
+ This method depends on the accuracy of your battery charger; results may vary.
+ If you add or replace equipment that changes the in-flight current draw (e.g. video transmitter, 
  camera, gimbal, motors, prop pitch/sizes, ESCs, etc.), you should recalibrate.</p>

<p>The general method is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fully charge your flight battery</li>
<li>Fly your craft, using &gt;50% of your battery pack capacity (estimated)</li>
<li>Note Cleanflight&rsquo;s reported mAh draw</li>
<li>Re-charge your flight battery, noting the mAh charging data needed to restore the pack to fully charged</li>
<li>Adjust <code>current_meter_scale</code> to according to the formula given below</li>
<li>Repeat and test</li>
</ol>

<p>Given (a) the reported mAh draw and the (b) mAh charging data, calculate a new <code>current_meter_scale</code> value as follows:
<code>
current_meter_scale = (charging_data_mAh / reported_draw_mAh) * old_current_meter_scale
</code>
For example, assuming:
+ A Cleanflight reported current draw of 1260 mAh
+ Charging data to restore full charge of 1158 mAh
+ A existing <code>current_meter_scale</code> value of 400 (the default)</p>

<p>Then the updated <code>current_meter_scale</code> is:
<code>
current_meter_scale = (charging_data_mAh / reported_draw_mAh) * old_current_meter_scale
                    = (1158 / 1260) * 400
                    = 368
</code></p>
