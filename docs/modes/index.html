<h1>Modes</h1>

<p>Cleanflight has various modes that can be toggled on or off.  Modes can be enabled/disabled by stick positions,
auxillary receiver channels and other events such as failsafe detection.</p>

<h2>Mode details</h2>

<h3>Headfree</h3>

<p>In this mode, the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the multicopter is always pointing to the same direction as when the feature was activated. This means that when the multicopter rotates around the Z axis (yaw), the controls will always respond according the same &ldquo;head&rdquo; direction.</p>

<p>With this mode it is easier to control the multicopter, even fly it with the physical head towards you since the controls always respond the same. This is a friendly mode to new users of multicopters and can prevent losing the control when you don&rsquo;t know the head direction. </p>

<h3>GPS Return To Home</h3>

<p>WORK-IN-PROGRESS.  This mode is not reliable yet, please share your experiences with the developers.</p>

<p>In this mode the aircraft attempts to return to the GPS position recorded when the aircraft was armed.</p>

<p>This mode should be enabled in conjunction with Angle or Horizon modes and an Altitude hold mode.</p>

<p>Requires a 3D GPS fix and minimum of 5 satellites in view.</p>

<h3>GPS Position Hold</h3>

<p>WORK-IN-PROGRESS.  This mode is not reliable yet, please share your experiences with the developers.</p>

<p>In this mode the aircraft attempts to stay at the same GPS position, as recorded when the mode is enabled.</p>

<p>Disabling and re-enabling the mode will reset the GPS hold position.</p>

<p>This mode should be enabled in conjunction with Angle or Horizon modes and an Altitude hold mode.</p>

<p>Requires a 3D GPS fix and minimum of 5 satellites in view.</p>

<h2>Auxillary Configuration</h2>

<p>Spare auxillary receiver channels can be used to enable/disable modes.  Some modes can only be enabled this way.</p>

<p>Configure your transmitter so that switches or dials (potentiometers) send channel data on channels 5 and upwards (the first 4 channels are usually occupied by the throttle, aileron, rudder, and elevator channels).</p>

<p><u>e.g. You can configure a 3 position switch to send 1000 when the switch is low, 1500 when the switch is in the middle and 2000 when the switch is high.</u></p>

<p>Configure your tx/rx channel limits to use values between 1000 and 2000.  The range used by mode ranges is fixed to 900 to 2100.</p>

<p>When a channel is within a specifed range the corresponding mode is enabled.</p>

<p>Use the GUI configuration tool to allow easy configuration when channel.</p>

<h3>CLI</h3>

<p>There is a CLI command, <code>aux</code> that allows auxillary configuration.  It takes 5 arguments as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>AUD range slot number (0 - 39)</li>
<li>mode id (see mode list above)</li>
<li>AUX channel index (AUX1 = 0, AUX2 = 1,&hellip; etc)</li>
<li>low position, from 900 to 2100. Should be a multiple of 25.</li>
<li>high position, from 900 to 2100. Should be a multiple of 25.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the low and high position are the same then the values are ignored.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<p>Configure AUX range slot 0 to enable ARM when AUX1 is withing 1700 and 2100.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">aux 0 0 0 1700 2100
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can display the AUX configuration by using the <code>aux</code> command with no arguments.</p>
