<h1>Building Manual.</h1>

<p>The manual PDF file is generated by concatenating relevant markdown files and by transforming the result using Gimli to obtain the final PDF file. This steps are handled automatically by the <code>build_manual.sh</code> script located in the root of the repository next to the Makefile.</p>

<h2>Requrements &amp; Installation</h2>

<p>The PDF manual generation uses the Gimli for the conversion. It can be installed via ruby gems. On Debian based systems the installation steps are:
<code>bash
    sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 ruby1.9.1-dev rubygems zlib1g-dev wkhtmltopdf libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
    sudo sudo gem1.9.1 install gimli
</code></p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>All markdown files need to be registered in the <code>build_manual.sh</code> file individually by modifying the <code>doc_files</code> variable / array:
<code>bash
doc_files=( &#39;Configuration.md&#39;
    &#39;Board - CC3D.md&#39;
    &#39;...&#39;
    &#39;...&#39;
)
</code></p>
