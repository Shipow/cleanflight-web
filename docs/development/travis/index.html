<h1>Travis</h1>

<p>Cleanflight provides Travis build and config files in the repository root. </p>

<h2>Pushing builds to a remote server</h2>

<p><code>.travis.sh</code> script can upload build artifacts to a remote server. This feature is controlled by the
<code>PUBLISH_URL</code> environment variable. If set, the build script will use the cURL binary and simulate
a file upload post to the configured server.</p>
