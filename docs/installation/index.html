<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Using the configurator</h2>

<p>This is a generic procedure to flash a board using the configurator. The configurator does not yet support all boards, so please check the documentation corresponding to your board before proceeding.</p>

<p>Make sure you have the <a href="https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight-configurator">Cleanflight Configurator</a> installed, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect the flight controller to the PC.</li>
<li>Start the Cleanflight Configurator.</li>
<li>Click on &ldquo;Disconnect&rdquo; if the configurator connected to the board automatically.</li>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;Firmware Flasher&rdquo; tab.</li>
<li>Make sure you have internet connectivity and click on the &ldquo;Load Firmware [Online]&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;Choose a Firmware / Board&rdquo; dropdown menu, and select the latest stable version for your flight controller.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: Read and understand the release notes that are displayed.  When upgrading review all release notes since your current firmware.</li>
<li>If this is the first time Cleanflight is flashed to the board, tick the &ldquo;Full Chip Erase&rdquo; checkbox.</li>
<li>Connect the flight controller board to the PC.  Ensure the correct serial port is selected.</li>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;Flash Firmware&rdquo; button and hold still (do not breathe, too).</li>
<li>When the progress bar becomes green and reads &ldquo;Programming: SUCCESSFUL&rdquo; you are done!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Manually</h2>

<p>See the board specific flashing instructions.</p>

<h1>Upgrading</h1>

<p>When upgrading be sure to backup / dump your existing settings.  Some firmware releases are not backwards compatible and default settings are restored when the FC detects an out of date configuration.</p>

<h2>Backup/Restore process</h2>

<p>See the CLI section of the docs for details on how to backup and restore your configuration via the CLI.</p>
