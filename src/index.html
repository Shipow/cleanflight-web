            <h3>Modern 32-bit hardware support</h3>
            <p>When 32-bit equipped flight controllers are so cheap, why hold yourself back with old 8-bit hardware and software? Cleanflight leverages the capabilities of modern embedded processors to give you the best control.</p>

            <h3>Modern development principles</h3>
            <p>As software grows over time it often becomes harder to maintain and fragile; Cleanflight attempts to bring modern software development practices to the table. We like and encourage understandable, decoupled, well-tested and self-explanatory code.</p>

            <h3>Broad hardware support</h3>
            <p>Cleanflight currently runs on 8 different boards and supports enough sensors and CPUs for you to adapt it to you own custom flight controller board, even more off-the-shelf hardware support is planned.</p>
